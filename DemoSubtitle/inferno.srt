00:00:07,102 --> 00:00:08,479
There is a switch,

3
00:00:09,028 --> 00:00:10,274
if you throw it,

4
00:00:10,523 --> 00:00:12,219
half the people on earth will die.

5
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:17,684
But if you don't, in a hundred years,

6
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:19,810
the human race will be extinct.

7
00:00:23,586 --> 00:00:25,317
I left you a path.

8
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:26,734
The hardest on yet.

9
00:00:29,778 --> 00:00:31,071
Only you can finish it.

10
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:34,368
You are humanity's final hope.

11
00:00:38,987 --> 00:00:40,289
It's Dante's Inferno.

12
00:00:40,539 --> 00:00:44,210
Dante defined a modern
conception of hell 700 years ago.

13
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,131
Why Dante?
Why this map of hell?

14
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,843
Someone created a plague.

15
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:00,976
Without professor Langdon,
no one can find the virus.

16
00:01:10,216 --> 00:01:11,445
Oh, my God!
